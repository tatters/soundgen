\usage{
lockToFormants(
  pitch,
  specEnv,
  formantSummary,
  rolloffMatrix = NULL,
  lockProb = 0.1,
  minLength = 3,
  plot = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pitch}{pitch contour, numeric vector (normally pitch_per_gc)}

\item{specEnv}{spectral envelope as returned by getSpectralEnvelope}

\item{rolloffMatrix}{rolloff matrix as returned by getRolloff}

\item{lockProb}{the (approximate) proportion of sound affected by formant locking}

\item{minLength}{the minimum number of consecutive pitch values affected (shorter segments of formant locking are ignored)}

\item{plot}{if TRUE, plots the original and modified pitch contour}
}
\description{
Internal soundgen function
}
\details{
When f0 or another relatively strong harmonic is close to one of the formants, the pitch contour is modified so as to "lock" it to this formant. The relevant metric is energy gain (ratio of amplitudes before and after the adjustment) penalized by the magnitude of the necessary pitch jump (in semitones) and the amplitude of the locked harmonic relative to f0.
