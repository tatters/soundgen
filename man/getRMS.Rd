\arguments{
\item{x}{path to a folder, wav or mp3 file, Wave object, or a numeric vector
representing the waveform}

\item{samplingRate}{sampling rate of \code{x} (only needed if \code{x} is a
numeric vector, rather than an audio file or Wave object)}

\item{scale}{maximum possible amplitude of input used for normalization of
input vector (only needed if \code{x} is a numeric vector, rather than an
audio file or Wave object)}

\item{from}{if NULL (default), analyzes the whole sound, otherwise
from...to (s)}

\item{to}{if NULL (default), analyzes the whole sound, otherwise
from...to (s)}

\item{windowLength}{length of FFT window, ms}

\item{step}{you can override \code{overlap} by specifying FFT step, ms (NB:
because digital audio is sampled at discrete time intervals of
1/samplingRate, the actual step and thus the time stamps of STFT frames
may be slightly different, eg 24.98866 instead of 25.0 ms)}

\item{overlap}{overlap between successive FFT frames, \%}

\item{killDC}{if TRUE, removed DC offset (see also \code{\link{flatEnv}})}

\item{normalize}{if TRUE, the RMS amplitude is returned as proportion of
the maximum possible amplitude as given by \code{scale}}

\item{windowDC}{the window for calculating DC offset, ms}

\item{summaryFun}{functions used to summarize each acoustic characteristic;
see \code{\link{analyze}}}

\item{reportEvery}{when processing multiple inputs, report estimated time
left every ... iterations}

\item{plot}{if TRUE, plot a contour of RMS amplitude}

\item{xlab, ylab}{general graphical parameters}

\item{type, col, lwd}{graphical parameters pertaining to the RMS envelope}

\item{...}{other graphical parameters}
}
\value{
Returns a list containing: \describe{\item{detailed}{a list of RMS
  amplitudes per frame for each sound, on the scale of input; names give time
  stamps for the center of each frame, in ms.} \item{summary}{a dataframe
  with summary measures, one row per sound}}
}
\description{
Calculates root mean square (RMS) amplitude in overlapping windows, providing
an envelope of RMS amplitude - a measure of sound intensity. Longer windows
provide smoother, more robust estimates; shorter windows and more overlap
improve temporal resolution, but they also increase processing time and make
the contour less smooth.
}
\details{
Note that you can also get similar estimates per frame from
\code{\link{analyze}} on a normalized scale of 0 to 1, but \code{getRMS} is
much faster, operates on the original scale, and plots the amplitude contour.
If you need RMS for the entire sound instead of per frame, you can simply
calculate it as \code{sqrt(mean(x^2))}, where \code{x} is your waveform.
Having RMS estimates per frame gives more flexibility: RMS per sound can be
calculated as the mean / median / max of RMS values per frame.

User-defined summary functions:
ran = function(x) diff(range(x))
meanSD = function(x) {
  paste0('mean = ', round(mean(x), 2), '; sd = ', round(sd(x), 2))
}
getRMS('~/Downloads/temp', summaryFun = c('mean', 'ran', 'meanSD'))$summary
